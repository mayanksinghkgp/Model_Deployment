# Model_Deployment
 Deploying a BERT model on AWS  
 
The project focuses on deployment a simple Multi-Label classification model trained using DistilBERT with the help of ktrain library. The model performs the task of identifying from an input of tweets whether it is related to a disaster (eg. Hurricane, floods, accidents etc.) or not.  
The model is built into a flsk app and it is deployed on an Ubuntu EC2 instance on AWS with the help of NGINX and WSgI.
